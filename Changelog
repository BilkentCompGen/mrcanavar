April 18, 2014:
	version 1.0 beta:
		* GC normalization is now less strict
		* Duplication windows are calculated through LW and SW. CW info for further filtering to be added.

September 4, 2013:
	version 0.51 released:
		* No new updates, only the bugfix below.

July 15, 2013:
		* Minor bug in CW counting is fixed.

July 2, 2013:
	version 0.5:
		* SAM files can now separately be read into *.depth files, and then merged. 
		* -nsam parameter to read specific SAM files in the READ mode.
		* New CONC mode (--conc) to concatenate/merge different *.depth files using the new -concdepth parameter. These different files may be from different library preparations (see below).
		* Multiple library support added.
		* Several bug fixes.

November 26, 2012:
	version 0.41:
		 * Bugs in non-autosomal chromosome processing for male samples are fixed.

September 23, 2012:
	version 0.4:
		 * Pseudoautosomal support added through -pseudoa paramater. You can enter the pseudoautosomal regions in BED format in the PREP mode. This is optional; but the configuration file generated and used by this version is not compatible with the previous versions. You need to recreate the configuration file using the PREP mode.
		 * Code cleanup to facilitate easier addition of new features.
